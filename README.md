  @Description :
 
  In embedded systems, the use of the C programming language is often greater.
  However, the number of C++ libraries has exceeded the number of c libraries with the use of Arduino.
  While C libraries are running in software written in C++, C++ libraries do not work in c based software.
  At this point, I think it is more advantageous to write c ++ based software to develop the project faster.
  This work is my first C++ based project.
